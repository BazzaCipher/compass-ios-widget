# Compass Schedule Widget

---

A homescreen widget for iOS/iPadOS using [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) to display a daily schedule for [Compass School Manager](https://www.compass.education).

## Why?

The Compass mobile app is "okay", but not particularly convenient (the student-facing interface appears to be somewhat neglected). The app also doesn't allow for any kind of colour customisation and doesn't work online. Yes, there's an iCAL export, but it isn't updated if the room or teacher changes. This widget is designed to solve this problem - allowing you quickly view your schedule and any changes to it.

## Features:

* **Completely customisable** - change class colours, titles, and hide unwanted activity types.
* **Works offline** - schedule data is cached, so you can still view your schedule without internet.
* **Fast** - updates in less than a second as it only needs to make one HTTP request.
* **Shows class changes** - if your teacher or room has been changed, the widget updates to reflect this.
* **Doubles are grouped together** - adjacent classes within a customisable threshold can be merged together.

**⚠️ Warning: If your classes have multiple teachers or rooms, the widget might behave in expected ways. ⚠️**

## Downloading and setting up the script

1. Download [Scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188) from the App Store.
2. Create a new script, and copy the code in ``scriptableInstaller.js`` into it. Run the script.

## Setting up authentication

1. Log in to your Compass account as normal in **a private browsing window in Chrome or Firefox.** This should be done on your PC or Mac. You'll need to use a private window so you don't accidentally log out of the session.
2. Open the developer tools (F12 usually works)
3. - Chrome:
     1. Switch to the "Application" tab in the Developer Tools.
     2. Go to "Cookies" in the sidebar, then select your Compass domain.
     3. Copy the "Value" text in the row that begins with "ASP"
   - Firefox:
     1. Switch to the "Storage" tab in the Developer Tools.
     2. Go to "Cookies" in the sidebar, and select your Compass domain.
     3. Copy the "Value" text in the row that begins with "ASP"
4. Open `CompassWidget` in the Scriptable editor and change `sessionToken: ""` to session token you copied in Step 3.
5. Now close the private window, making sure that you **do not log out of Compass.**

You should now be able to run the script and view the widget preview.

## Adding to home screen

To add the widget to your homescreen, switch to the "Scriptable" section in the widget chooser and choose either the "large" or "extra large" sizes (smaller sizes aren't currently supported). Choose the "CompassWidget" script, and change "When Interacting" to "Run Script".

The widget will update periodically depending on device usage - this behaviour is controlled by iOS and can't be customised.

## Configuring/Customising

Modify the `widgetConfig` object to customise and configure the widget.
